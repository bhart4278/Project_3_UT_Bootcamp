## Project Overview

**Project Description**
  - This project focuses on collecting, processing, and visualizing earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) GeoJSON service. The dataset includes earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher occurring in the Conterminous U.S. region between January 1, 1975, and January 10, 2025. The data was fetched, processed, and visualized using Python, JavaScript, and popular visualization libraries.

**Data Source**
The data was retrieved using the following GeoJSON URL: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query.geojson?starttime=1975-01-01%2000:00:00&endtime=2025-01-10%2023:59:59&maxlatitude=50&minlatitude=24.6&maxlongitude=-65&minlongitude=-125&minmagnitude=4.5&orderby=time

This dataset contains:

  - Magnitude of the earthquakes.

  - Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).

  - Place and time of occurrence.

  - Other metadata related to each earthquake event.
